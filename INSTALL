* Requirements
* Installation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Requirements

  * Unix or an unix-like operating system
    - coWiki is meant to run on Unix/Linux or similar operating system.
      It *might* run on Windows but it is not tested and currently not
      supported.
  * Apache 1.3.13 web server or later version
  * MySQL 3.23.23 database or later version
  * PHP 5.0.x or later version
  * of course all together up and running

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Installation

  * Unpack the cowiki-x.x.x.tar.gz file. You will find following
    directories:

      htdocs/
      includes/
      misc/

  * Copy "htdocs/" and "includes/" to your virtual host location.

    The "includes/" directory MUST NOT be read by an user agent (browser) -
    it should reside outside the document root.

  * Make sure to change owner and group of all files to fit your webserver
    setup.

  * Create a database table with your preferred name (e.g. "cowiki") and a
    connector user with all rights granted to this database table. Reload
    the database to apply your changes.

  * Install the database using the appropriate "misc/database/*.sql" schema

  * Make sure that PHPs "include_path" setting points to the "htdocs/" and
    coWiki "includes/" directories. This could look like:

      include_path = ".:../includes/cowiki"

    The include path might be set in the webserver configuration file(s)
    permanently (do not forget to restart the httpd after you have changed
    its configuration) or in the "/htdocs/.htaccess" file.

  * In your virtual host directory, change to "includes/cowiki/"
    * copy the "core.conf-dist" file to "core.conf"
    * edit the "core.conf" file and set the appropriate values. At least
      set these values for the following directives:
    
      [.DOCUMENT]
          RESOURCE = "..."

      [.AUTH]
          RESOURCE = "..."

      [.USER]
          RESOURCE = "..."

      In a standard standalone installation, all three values for RESOURCE
      are equal.

    * Set an encrypted password for the coWiki administrator ("root" user)
      in the [.AUTH] section.

      ROOT_PASSWD = "..."

      You may generate this encrypted password using a "crypt" or "htpasswd"
      command or just let it generate through the "crypt.php" script comming
      with your cowiki installation: <http://your.cowiki/crypt.php>. Do not
      use the "crypt.php" script of foreign existing coWiki installations
      on the net to encrypt your password.

      With this new password you are able to change the current coWiki user
      to the build-in user "root" with administrative privileges. It is
      recommended to change the password periodically for security reasons.

    * Depending on your server setup, you might want to adjust the paths
      used by coWiki in the [PATH] section - e.g. where to store temporary
      and cache files.

  * In case that you are running PHP as DSO (module for apache): change the
    access of the "core.conf" file to 0600 for the web server user id.

  * In case that you are running PHP via CGI (standalone executable):
    change the access of the "core.conf" file to 0600 for the user id the
    CGI is running.

  * After all, start your coWiki with <http://your.cowiki/>. If it doesn't
    work, have a cup of tea and re-read the requirements and the
    installation procedure.

  * HINT: If coWiki does not work for you out of the box, please watch
          the error.log of your virtual host where coWiki is located in:

          tail -f /PATH/TO/YOUR/VHOST/logs/error.log
          
          Depending on your webserver configuration, you might find the
          required data in the global webserver log file instead.
