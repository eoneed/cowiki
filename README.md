# coWiki

coWiki is a sophisticated but easy to use web collaboration tool that helps
you and your co-workers to create and organize web documents, weblogs and
knowledgebases or any other document structures directly in their HTML
browser. You may evolve ideas and gain a concomitant XML documentation of
your brainstorming without having to concentrate on complicated structural
syntaxes.

Please read the INSTALL file for requirement and installation issues.

A few coWiki features:

  * Editing of documents (web pages) in a HTML browser.
  * Automatic resolving of document links.
  * Possibility to rename any document at any time without leaving broken
    links. All links to other documents remain consistant even if you or
    someone else renames or moves a document.
  * Hierarchical directory/document structure that can be nested as deep
    as you wish. You do not get lost, the breadcrumb navigation tells you
    where you are.
  * Unixlike access management with owner/group/world access permissions
    (and restricted visibility) for each document or directory tree.
  * Document revision management, comparing, colored diff'ing and recovery
    of documents
  * Documents are parsed to XML for further export/transformation.
  * Threaded forums for registered users
  * Plugin support through a defined API. Add your functions to coWiki.
  * Template based and multilingual.
  * Administration backend for complete management of this software and
    its users.
  * ... and probably a few more things you will like.
